**[27 Oct 2021]** I presented "[Fast quantum state tomography via accelerated non-convex programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07006)" at [INFORMS 2021](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/anaheim2021/).
**[20 Oct 2021]** Our paper "[Acceleration and Stability of the Stochastic Proximal Point Algorithm](https://jlylekim.github.io/publication/preprint/sppam-opt2021/)" has been accepted for a spotlight presentation at [NeurIPS 2021 Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/ScheduleMultitrack?event=21836).
**[24 Jul 2021]** I am co-organizing a workshop "[Beyond first-order methods in ML systems](https://sites.google.com/view/optml-icml2021/home)" in ICML 2021. (Co-organizers: [Albert S. Berahas](https://aberahas.engin.umich.edu/), [Raghu Bollapragada](https://sites.google.com/view/raghub/home), [Rixon Crane](https://rixonc.github.io/), [Amir Gholami](http://amirgholami.org/), [Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/), [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/), [Fred Roosta](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/FredRoosta/), and [Rachael Tappenden](https://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~r.tappenden/)).
**[15 Apr 2021]** I passed my qualification exam (research project defense). Committee: Profs. [Anastasios Kyrillidis](https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/) (chair), [Santiago Segarra](https://segarra.rice.edu/), and [Richard Baraniuk](http://richb.rice.edu/).
**[14 Apr 2021]** Our paper "[Fast quantum state tomography via accelerated non-convex programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07006)" is on arXiv.
